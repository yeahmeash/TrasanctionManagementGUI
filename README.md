# Bank Management Application
Bank Management Application is a simple JavaFX application that demonstrates how to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation application for managing bank accounts. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic banking operations such as creating new accounts, viewing account details, updating account information, and deleting accounts. The application utilizes MySQL as the database for storing and retrieving account data.

## Prerequisites 📋
Before running the Bank Management JavaFX Application, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.

* **JavaFX**: Since the Bank Management Application is built using JavaFX, you need to have JavaFX properly set up in your project. If you're using JDK 11 or later, JavaFX is no longer bundled with it. You can download JavaFX from the OpenJFX website and configure it based on your specific IDE or build tool.

* **MySQL Database**: Install and set up a MySQL database server on your machine. Create a new database for the Bank Management Application and configure the necessary tables and columns for storing account information.
